            answer = "A menstrual cycle begins with the first day of your period, or menstruation [MEN-stroo-AY-shuhn] and starts over again when the next period begins. Throughout a monthly menstrual cycle, your body makes different amounts of chemicals called hormones to prepare for pregnancy. These changing hormone levels can cause menstrual symptoms. Menstrual cycles often change as a woman gets older. A normal cycle lasts between 24 and 38 days."

            "What is menstruation? ",
            answer = "Menstruation is a woman’s monthly bleeding, often called your “period.” When you menstruate, your body discards the monthly buildup of the lining of your uterus (womb). Menstrual blood and tissue flow from your uterus through the small opening in your cervix and pass out of your body through your vagina.\n" +

Your periods are still “regular” if they usually come every 24 to 38 days.3 This means that the time from the first day of your last period up to the start of your next period is at least 24 days but not more than 38 days.\n" +

            question = "What is ovulation?",
            answer = "Ovulation is when the ovary releases an egg so it can be fertilized by a sperm in order to make a baby. A woman is most likely to get pregnant if she has sex without birth control in the three days before and up to the day of ovulation (since the sperm are already in place and ready to fertilize the egg as soon as it is released). A man’s sperm can live for 3 to 5 days in a woman’s reproductive organs, but a woman’s egg lives for just 12 to 24 hours after ovulation.\n" +

            question = "How do I know if I’m ovulating?",
            answer = "A few days before you ovulate, your vaginal mucus or discharge changes and becomes more slippery and clear. This type of mucus helps sperm move up into your uterus and into the fallopian tubes where it can fertilize an egg. Some women feel minor cramping on one side of their pelvic area when they ovulate. Some women have other signs of ovulation.\n" +

                    "Luteinizing hormone (LH) is a hormone released by your brain that tells the ovary to release an egg (called ovulation). LH levels begin to surge upward about 36 hours before ovulation, so some women and their doctors test for LH levels. LH levels peak about 12 hours before ovulation.1 Women who are tracking ovulation to become pregnant will notice a slight rise in their basal temperature (your temperature after sleeping before you get out of bed) around ovulation.
